# gsum Improvements - Claude Code Integration

## Overview
Enhanced gsum to provide better visibility and control when running through Claude Code or other AI assistants.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Progress Indicators
- Added real-time progress indicators showing elapsed time
- Shows animated dots to indicate activity
- Clear status messages at each stage

### 2. Verbose Logging
- Automatic verbose mode detection when running through Claude Code
- Enhanced logging with emojis for better readability:
  - üöÄ Starting execution
  - üìç Working directory
  - üìù Prompt details
  - üîç Analysis progress
  - ‚úÖ Completion status
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout warnings

### 3. Configurable Timeouts
- Default 5-minute timeout (300 seconds)
- Configurable via `GSUM_TIMEOUT` environment variable (in milliseconds)
- Graceful termination with clear error messages
- Shows elapsed time before timeout

### 4. Real-time Output Streaming
- Shows Gemini/Claude output in real-time when verbose mode is enabled
- Better error reporting with stderr capture
- Progress updates every 500ms

### 5. Claude Code Detection
- Automatically enables verbose mode when `CLAUDE_CODE` or `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_TOOLS_ACTIVE` environment variables are detected
- Provides better context for AI assistants about what's happening

## Usage

### Normal Usage
```bash
gsum                     # Regular output
gsum --verbose          # Enable verbose mode manually
```

### Claude Code Usage
```bash
gsum                     # Auto-enables verbose mode
gsum save               # Shows progress indicators
gsum --claude-execute   # Better timeout handling
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export GSUM_TIMEOUT=600000  # 10 minutes timeout
gsum save                   # Will timeout after 10 minutes instead of 5
```

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
1. `/cli/lib/gemini.js` - Added timeout handling and progress indicators
2. `/cli/lib/claude.js` - Added timeout handling and real-time output
3. `/cli/lib/generator.js` - Added Claude Code detection and enhanced logging

### New Features
- Spawn-based process execution for better control
- Real-time stdout/stderr streaming
- Configurable timeouts with cleanup
- Progress indicators with elapsed time
- Environment-based verbose mode detection

### Error Handling
- Clear timeout errors with elapsed time
- Better quota exceeded messages
- Graceful cleanup of child processes
- Preserved original error handling logic

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can see that gsum is actively working
2. **Timeout Prevention**: No more hanging processes with configurable timeouts
3. **AI Assistant Integration**: Better visibility when running through Claude Code
4. **Debugging**: Verbose mode provides detailed execution information
5. **Real-time Feedback**: See output as it's generated rather than waiting

## Future Enhancements

1. Add support for progress percentage based on file count
2. Add support for cancellation via Ctrl+C
3. Add support for resuming interrupted operations
4. Add support for parallel processing indicators
5. Add support for custom progress messages per stage
